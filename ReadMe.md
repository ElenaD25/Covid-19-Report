#About Covid-19 Report

I know that at the time of publishing this report the pandemy is no longer an actual subject, but i decided to make this report to learn Power BI.

##Actions done

- imported data sources from Git directly in Power BI, using the URL
- cleaned data (changed column data types, unpivoted columns, replaced null values, columns renamed)
- merged queries (to get many columns in one single table, instead of 3)
- made DAX calculations (for Death Rate, Fatality Ratio, Incident Rate, Today Cases, Total Confirmed, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Occurence of each vaccine to find the most used vaccines)
- create charts
